Jingle Ringford

Welcome to the North Pole, KringleCon, and the 2022 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge! I’m Jingle Ringford, one of Santa’s elves.

Santa asked me to come here and give you a short orientation to this festive event.

Before you move forward through the gate, I’ll ask you to accomplish a few simple tasks.

First things first, here's your badge! It's the five golden rings in the middle of your avatar.

Great - now you're official!

Click on the badge on your avatar. That’s where you will see your Objectives, Hints, and gathered Items for the Holiday Hack Challenge.

We’ve also got handy links to the KringleCon talks and more there for you!

Next, click on that machine to the left and create a crypto wallet for yourself. Don't lose that key!

...

Fantastic!

OK, one last thing. Click on the Cranberry Pi Terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

...

Great! Your orientation is now complete! You can enter through the gate now. Have FUN!!!
