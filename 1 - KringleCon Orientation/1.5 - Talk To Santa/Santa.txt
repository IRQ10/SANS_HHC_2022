Santa

Welcome to the North Pole, intrepid traveler!

Wow, we had quite a storm last night!

My castle door is sealed shut behind a giant snowbank.

The Elves have decided to burrow under the snow to get everything ready for our holiday deliveries.

But there's another wrinkle: my Five Golden Rings have gone missing.

Without the magic of the Rings, we simply can't launch the holiday season.

My reindeer won't fly; I won't be able to zip up and down chimneys.

What's worse, without the magic Rings, I can't fit the millions of cookies in my belly!

I challenge you to go on a quest to find and retrieve each of the five Rings.

I'll put some initial goals in your badge for you.

The holidays, and the whole world, are counting on you.

Santa - Post-completion

Adventurer! Hurry on into my castle. A holiday miracle has occured!
