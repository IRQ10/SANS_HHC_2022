Hm?.. Hello...

Sorry, I don't mean to be uncharaceristically short with you.

There's just this abominable Snowrog here, and I'm trying to comprehend Suricata to stop it from getting into the kitchen.

I believe that if I can phrase these Suricata incantations correctly, they'll create a spell that will generate warnings.

And hopefully those warnings will scare off the Snowrog!

Only... I'm quite baffled. Maybe you can give it a go?

Woo hoo - you wielded Suricata magnificently! Thank you!

Now to shout the final warning of power to the Snowrog...

YOU...SHALL NOT...PASS!!!
