Sparkle Redberry
Hey there! Iâ€™m Sparkle Redberry. We have a bit of an incident here.

We were baking lembanh in preparation for the holidays.

It started to smell a little funky, and then suddenly, a Snowrog crashed through the wall!

We're trying to investigate what caused this, so we can make it go away.

Have you used Wireshark to look at packet capture (PCAP) files before?

I've got a PCAP you might find interesting.

Once you've had a chance to look at it, please open this terminal and answer the questions in the top pane.

Thanks for helping us get to the bottom of this!

You got it - wonderful!

So hey, when you're looking at the next terminal, remember you have multiple filetypes and tools you can utilize.

Conveniently for us, we can use programs already installed on every Windows computer.

So if you brought your own Windows machine, you can save the files to it and use whatever method is your favorite.

Oh yeah! If you wanna learn more, or get stuck, I hear Eric Pursley's talk is about this very topic.
