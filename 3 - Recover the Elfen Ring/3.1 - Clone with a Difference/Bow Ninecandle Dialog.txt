I've heard there's multiple methods, but I only know how to do one.

Wow - great work! Thank you!

Say, if you happen to be testing containers for security, there are some things you should think about.

Developers love to give ALL TeH PERMz so that things "just work," but it can cause real problems.

It's always smart to check for excessive user and container permissions.

You never know! You might be able to interact with host processes or filesystems!
