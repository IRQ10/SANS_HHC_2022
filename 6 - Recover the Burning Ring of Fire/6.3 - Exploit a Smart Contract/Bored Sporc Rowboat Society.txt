*This is an artist's rendering of the clubhouse we're considering building if we end up, like, rollin' in it after this NFT thing takes off. This does not represent the actual clubhouse which right now is kinda just, like, the bottom level of my parent's cave. I moved home about ten years ago, after I got, like, laid-off from my job working Sporc Squad for Beast Buy. My boss, Chordclak, was a total lamer... Anyway, that picture isn't the real clubhouse. My old girlfriend, Glanchorf, she drew that. I always told her that she should go to art school and stuff because, like, she was really talented and all, but she just kept working at Burgher King and eventually she dumped me for that lamer Chordclak. I kept the picture though, and decided to use it on this site.

And just in case you're reading this Chordclak, I'm gonna be rich and you suck.



Chorizo
Do you not have the slightest inclination of who I am?

How did I, Count Chorizo, Herald of Rrrrepugnance, not receive an invitation to the presale?

I could purchase every one of your wares, but now you shan't have a single cent from me!

I will see to it that you nevah do business in these warrens agayn!

...
Chorizo
Well...I...never...

How was a plebeian such as yourself granted access to the pre-sale?
I present thee with a proffer to purchase the NFT you've acquired for twice the price.

Hwhat? You shan't vend to me? Have you any idea who I am?

You just refused the abhorrent Count Chorizo!

I shall ensure you are nevah able to transact with that NFT agayn!

Luigi
Psst. Hey, slick - over here. Myeah.

You look like a sucker ahem I mean, savvy.

I got some exclusive, very rare, very valuable NFTs for sale.

But I run a KringleCoin-only business. Kapeesh?

Ever buy somethin' with cryptocurrency before?

Didn't think so, but if you wheel and deal with ya' pal Luigi here, now you can!

But we're currently in pre-sale, and you gotta be on the list. Myeah, see?

BSRS NFTs are a swell investment. They'll be worth a pretty penny, and that's a promise.

So when they're purchasable, you better snatch 'em up before the other boneheads ahem I mean, eggheads do.

I got a business to run. You can't buy nothin' right now, so scram. Kapeesh?

Luigi
What!? How'd you get on the list? What's that? You's a double agent, and you're actually workin' for us?

I don't know if I buy that, but you're on the list, so... myeah.

Somethin' about this ain't sittin' right with me, but there's no reversing transactions with cryptocurrency.

That NFT is yours to keep, but if I find out you're lyin' to me, Palzari's gonna pay you a visit. Kapeesh?

Slicmer
Don't bug me, kid. Luigi needs me to keep an eye on these offers you can't refute.

The boss told me to watch them for any shifty transactions from wallets that aren't on the pre-sale list.

He said to use this Block Explo... Exploder... thing.

With this, I can see all the movement of the uh... non-fungusable tokens.

Once on the blockchain, it's there forever for the whole world to see.

So if I spot anything that don't look right, I can let Luigi know, and Palzari will get to the bottom of it.

She looks sweet, but she's actually the boss' enforcer. Have you talked to her yet? She even scares me!

It sure would be fun to watch you get on her bad side. Heh heh.


Slicmer
Hmph... this is so boring...

"This is a serious task" he said, "not a sporc headbutting-party" he said.

"Mess this up, Slicmer, and I'll tie a rock to your feet and throw you down a well!" he said.

I think this job was just to keep me out of his way. Luigi thinks I'm a blockhead.

Well I think he's a -- Huh? Wait a minute...

Hey! Boss! I think I see somethin'!
