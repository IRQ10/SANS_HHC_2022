So, I've heard a rumor that you lost the<br>Private Key to your KringleCoin wallet.
I must admit, I'm more than a little disappointed in you.
I'm sure that you were told that if you lose your Private Key,
it CAN'T be recovered...
Well, I suppose that isn't entirely true...
Christmas Magic can do even those things that are,
otherwise, impossible
But you've been naughty, and before I'll use
Christmas Magic to recover your key,
you need to prove yourself!
I'm going to need you to go on a quest...
First, you'll need to find Yukon Cornelius,
and help him track down what he calls a Bumble
Take a tooth from the Bumble and carry it deep
into the Misty Mountains, and trade it with Gwairhair,
Windlord of the Great Eagles, for one of his feathers.
If Gwairhair is reluctant to trade,
tell him that I have sent you.
With that feather, you must scale the walls of Sombertown,
and find the home of Burgermeister Meisterburger.
Take the feather, and tickle Burgermeister Meisterburger,
so that he may laugh and feel joy!
Once he feels joy, he'll happily give you
safe passage to the Isle of Misfit Toys...
There, you must find Dolly, and tell her that a horrible
mistake has been made and she's perfectly fine...
Not a misfit at all...
Thus, having set right one of the greatest wrongs
of the Christmas season, you will
have proved yourself worthy!
Then, if you come back here, I will tell you...	
	...that your key is

	Write it down,
	NOW
	, mmmmmkay?
