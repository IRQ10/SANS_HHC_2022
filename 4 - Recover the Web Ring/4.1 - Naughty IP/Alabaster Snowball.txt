Alabaster Snowball

Hey there! I'm Alabaster Snowball

And I have to say, I'm a bit distressed.

I was working with the dwarves and their Boria mines, and I found some disturbing activity!

Looking through these artifacts, I think something naughty's going on.

Can you please take a look and answer a few questions for me?

First, we need to know where the attacker is coming from.

If you haven't looked at Wireshark's Statistics menu, this might be a good time!

Aha, you found the naughty actor! Next, please look into the account brute force attack.

You can focus on requests to /login.html~

Alice? I totally expected Eve! Well how about forced browsing? What's the first URL path they found that way?

The misses will have HTTP status code 404 and, in this case, the successful guesses return 200.

Great! Just one more challenge! It looks like they made the server pull credentials from IMDS. What URL was forced?

AWS uses a specific IP address for IMDS lookups. Searching for that in the PCAP should get you there quickly.

Fantastic! It seems simpler now that I've seen it once. Thanks for showing me!

Hey, so maybe I can help you out a bit with the door to the mines.

First, it'd be great to bring an Elvish keyboard, but if you can't find one, I'm sure other input will do.

Instead, take a minute to read the HTML/JavaScript source and consider how the locks are processed.

Next, take a look at the Content-Security-Policy header. That drives how certain content is handled.

Lastly, remember that input sanitization might happen on either the client or server ends!
