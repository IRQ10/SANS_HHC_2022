Akbowl

Huh - what? Why do you disturb Akbowl?

I'm trying to get the ring in here for the Sporc Chief.

Unlucky for me it's lost in this water basin thing.

You will not get it out before Akbowl!

Akbowl
No! That's not yours!

This birdbath showed me images of this happening.

But I didn't believe it because nobody is better than Akbowl!

Akbowl's head is the hardest! That's what the other sporcs tell me.

I guess Akbowl's head is not the smartest.
